#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ship.sh — the gate between "it compiles" and "it is a build".
#
# One verb for an agent to call. It runs the stages, then prints a verdict block that is meant
# to be read by a model as much as by a person:
#
#   ── PYGMALION SHIP VERDICT ─────────────
#   VERDICT: GREEN
#   ...
#   ───────────────────────────────────
#
# The vocabulary matters more than the stages. There are three verdicts, and the difference
# between two of them is the whole reason this file exists:
#
#   GREEN  every stage asked for passed.
#   RED    a stage failed. The code is wrong. Do not ship, do not retry blindly.
#   AMBER  a stage could not be run — no device, no network. NOTHING WAS LEARNED about the
#          code. An agent that reads AMBER as RED reverts good work; one that reads it as
#          GREEN ships untested work. It is neither.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/ship.sh                 unit tests + debug APK
#   tools/ship.sh --smoke         ... and the on-device canary (installs on the target — see below)
#   tools/ship.sh --release       ... assemble release instead of debug
#   tools/ship.sh --detach        run in the background, write build/ship/status; poll that
#                                 (a cold build can outlast an agent's tool timeout)
#
# --smoke INSTALLS com.cocakova.pygmalion (debug) on the connected device, replacing what is there.
# It is off by default for that reason.
